# vam-posters-classification-map
This repo is using p5.js machine learning library ml5.js to classify the poster of Victoria and Albert Museum fetched by their open access API. For the visualization I'm using Three.js to create a 3d space and group based on classification clusters and displaying the clusters in descending order.
